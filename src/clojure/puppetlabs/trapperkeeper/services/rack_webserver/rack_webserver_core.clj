      ;; the original config.ru that is provided by the user, but we need to

      ;; gem path: e.g. GEM_PATH, GEM_HOME, potentially others.  RUBYLIB is
      ;; probably a concern as well.  We really, really *don't* want the app to
      ;; try to load gems and code from outside of the JVM environment, so we

      ;; runtime will not see any environment variables at all.

      ;; environment variables.  It might be a better approach to simply take
      ;; a copy of the "real" environment variables map, and clear out the
      ;; ones we care about (GEM_PATH, etc.).  But for now, rather than trying
